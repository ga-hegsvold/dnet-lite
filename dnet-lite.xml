		<title>Dice</title>
		<para>
      For optimal gameplay each player and the Game Master (GM) should have two 10-sided
      dice (2d10) of different color and two 6-sided dice (2d6).
    </para>

			<title>Reroll Method</title>
			<para>
        For Task Resolution, DNet uses an open-ended die roll method designated d10-d10*.
        Use two ten sided dice of contrasting colors.
        Each dice can generate a result from 1 to 10: the 0 on the dice is considered
        to be a 10.
      </para>
			<para>
        Before rolling, choose which dice will be the positive dice and which will be
        the negative one. In the example below, the white dice is positive, while
        the black one is negative. You then roll the two dice and substract the
        negative one from the positive one.
      </para>
			<para>
        When you roll a 10 on one (or both) dice, you compute the partial result and
        reroll the 10, adding or substracting the new roll, as appropriate. If you
        also roll a 10 on the reroll, you add it to the partial result and reroll
        again. You reroll as long as you keep rolling 10s... or until the GM asks to
        verify your dice. ;)
      </para>
			<para>
        Using this method is denoted as d10-d10* throughout the document.
      </para>
			<example>
				<title>d10-d10*</title>

Black dice (-):  2
Partial result:  8

			<title>Character Concept</title>
			<para>
        The most important thing to keep in mind when creating a character, is the
        <emphasis>concept</emphasis> of the character.
        The concept is like an idea or a vision of the character.
        <!-- What is his name? What does he look like? -->
			</para>
			<para>
        A good starting points for a concept could be a picture, a movie character, or
        anything else you might find inspiring. Be creative and have fun!
      </para>
			<para>
        At this early stage of the character creation process, the character concept
        is by no means chiseled in stone.
        Figuring out a concept is just a tool for making a more believable character.
        It helps define your character's <emphasis>style</emphasis>. His personality.
        How he acts. How he tends to deal with conflicts.

        If you want to play a character with magical abilities, this part is very important.
        Style defines how a character does magic.
        Personality and state of mind colors the magical effects.
        See <xref linkend="magic"/>.
      </para>
			<para>
        When you have a good idea of the character concept you want to play, it's
        time to move on to the statistics.
        While doing the following steps, keep this concept in mind and let the statistics
        reflect and emphasise the concept.

			<title>Starting Experience</title>

        The TPs are used to buy Talents.
        The EPs are used to buy Species, Skills and Specialties.

		<para>
      Each round (6 seconds) your character can make two actions.
      For each additional action performed, a cumulative -5 penalty is added
      to every action.
    </para>
		<para>
      Example: 2 actions: no penalty; 3 actions: -5 to all 3 actions;
      6 actions: -20 to all 6 actions.
    </para>
		<para>
      Multiple actions shortcut formula: <literal>Penalty = -5 * (n-2)</literal>
      where <literal>n</literal> is the total number of actions performed.
    </para>
		<para>
      As the observant reader probably has seen, a character performing only one action
      in a round will have a "penalty" of +5 ( <literal>-5 * (1-2) = -5 * -1 = +5</literal> ) according to this formula.
      This is not a fault in the formula. On the contrary, it makes perfect sense.
      When a character spends more time concentrating on a single action he or she
      (or it) should be rewarded with a bonus.

Description of effect potency:
Minor:
- Gain knowledge about and understanding of phenomena within the magical
  domain's scope.
- Elementary manipulation of phenomena within the magical domain's scope,
  enough to activate them and/or bestow directions.
- Gain sensory perception of phenomena within the magical domain's scope.

Moderate:
- Exert elementary command and control over phenomena within the magical
  domain's scope.
- Conceal, camouflage or hide phenomena within the magical domain's scope
  from scrutiny.
- Protect a target from harmful effects created from within the magical
  domain's scope.

Major:
- Alter the capabilities or functions of phenomena withing the magical
	domain's scope.
- Injure a target.
- Fortify, bolster or improve phenomena within the magical domain's scope.

Extreme:
- Transform phenomena within the magical domain's scope into related
  phenomena or shapes, or replace their capabilities or functions with
  different ones.
- Significantly injure a target, degrade its capabilities or negatively
  transform it.

Total:
- Create phenomena within the magical domain's scope from nothing.
- Destroy or mutilate a target.

Minimal life: Plants?
Simple life: Bacteria/Virus
Moderate life: Insects
Complex life: Reptiles/Mammals

Defaults:
- Potency: 0? Power of the effect (TD to dispell)
- Targets: 1 target (SR: -5 to 5 or just 0?) or based on target's WIL
- Duration: 1 round (app. 6 sec)

Increase:
- Potency: 1-to-1 (+1 TD to dispell => +1 TD to cast)
- Targets: +5 TD pr additional creature + creature's SR/WIL
- Duration: +1 TD pr round

Spell casting and fatigue:
- If the spell succeeds no fatigue is gained.
- For every 5 points of failure the mage gains 1 fatigue.
	Ex:
	TD- 1 to TD- 5: 1 fatigue
	TD- 6 to TD-10: 2 fatigue
	TD-11 to TD-15: 3 fatigue
